            <hr class="underline">
            <p>
                I am a 20-year-old Computer Science undergraduate with a passion for technology, creativity, and adventure.
                I specialize in frontend development, constantly improving my skills in building modern, user-friendly websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I love gaming, traveling, and exploring new places. Cooking and baking is another hobby of mine.
                I enjoy experimenting with different cuisines. When I’m not at my desk, you’ll probably find me hanging out with
                friends, bowling, or enjoying outdoor activities. I also have a deep appreciation for nature and love spending
                time in scenic spots.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m always looking to learn, create, and experience new things. Feel free to connect with me!
